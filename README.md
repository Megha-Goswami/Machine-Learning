1. Explored Linear Regression using Bike rental Case Study. Will add regularization techniques- Ridge and Lasso for exploration in the same dataset
2. Explored Logistic Regression using Lead Score Case Study. Used Random Forest Regressor for feature importance, also cheked the model's working with Random Forest Regressor, as Loistic regression is giving pretty good evaluation metric, rejected random forest for this dataset.
